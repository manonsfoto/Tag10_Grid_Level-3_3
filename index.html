        <h3>Shattering cookware</h3>
        <p>
          More than 37,000 people were injured from using cookware. Hot handles
          can burn and sometimes glass cookware can shatter.

        <h3>Microwave oven burns</h3>
        <p>
          More than 10,000 people were hurt using microwaves. Burns were most
          common.

        <h3>Knife cuts</h3>
        <p>
          Lacerations caused by knives of all kinds (not just the kitchen type)
          affected more than 350,000 people in 2012, according to the Consumer
          Product Safety Commission. Dull knives are actually more dangerous
          than sharp ones, because they require more pressure to use and their
          worn edge can cause the knife to slip off food and into your fingers.

        <h3>Cooking fires</h3>
        <p>
          Fires involving cooking equipment account for two of every five
          reported home fires. Unattended cooking equipment accounts for one in
          three fires, and half are ignited by fat, grease, oil, or related
          substances, according to the National Fire Protection Association.

        <h3>Contact Burns From Equipment</h3>
        <p>
          The oven is magic. No longer do we have to sear our food on an open
          fire like our ancestors did; we have a nifty box that keeps the heat
          contained and cooks our food to perfection. But all that heat combined
          with metal components and cookware leads to loads of burns. Quick tips
          (which are obvious, but good to keep in mind): Always use oven mitts,
          replace them when they’re old; don’t use a wet towel as an oven mitt;
          don’t reach your arm in to check baked goods, pull out the rack to
          test;

        <h3>Death to the Pathogens</h3>
        <p>
          The most insidious of all dangers, perhaps, are the germs lurking in
          your food. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
          estimates that each year roughly one in six Americans (or 48 million
          people) gets sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die of
          foodborne diseases. The top five culprits sending Americans to the
          hospital are salmonella, norovirus, Campylobacter spp., Toxoplasma
          gondii and E.coli – but much can be done in terms of proper food
          handling, cooking and storage to help prevent these pathogens from
          causing illness.
